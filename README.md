# About

The goal here is to create a language learning tool to track your journey and help keep you in track.

The project is inspired by the spreadsheet created by [Stevijs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gIu00WcbTI) and since i'm using it for free and it's helping me a lot, the software will be free to use and open source as well.

Feel free to open issues and PR for bugs/features.

# Features

* Sick looking charts
* Optional duolingo style terrorism
* Future projections based on your current progress rate
* That's all, i want a simple software.
